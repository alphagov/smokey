  @normal @notintegration @ignore_javascript_errors
  Scenario: check licensing app is present
    Given I am testing "licensing"
      And I am testing through the full stack
      And I force a varnish cache miss
    Then I should be able to visit:
      | Path                                                              |
      | /apply-for-a-licence/test-licence/westminster/apply-1             |
      | /apply-for-a-licence/test-licence/westminster/apply-1/form        |
      | /apply-for-a-licence/forms/bury/test-licence/9999-7-1,0-1         |
