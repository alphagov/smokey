Feature: Whitehall

  @notpreview
  Scenario: There should be no authentication for Whitehall
    Given the "whitehall" application has booted
    And I am testing through the full stack
    And I force a varnish cache miss
    And I am not an authenticated user
    Then I should be able to view policies
    And I should be able to view publications
    Then I should be able to visit:
      | Path                             |
      | /government/|
      | /government/announcements        |
