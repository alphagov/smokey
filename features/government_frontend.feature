Feature: Government Frontend

  Background:
    Given I am testing through the full stack
    And I force a varnish cache miss

    Scenario Outline: Check example pages across formats
      When I request "<Path>"
      Then I should get a 200 status code

      Examples:
        | Path                                                                                                  |
